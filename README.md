Changes include:

- Swapping zlib for brotli to generate smaller URLs
- Renaming `index.html` to `create.html`
- Removing the ability to load from query parameters
- Only creating one category on load
- Splitting mobile share and copy-to-clipboard

To do:

- Because brotli support requires Web Workers, and because the mobile share functionality requires HTTPS, no reason not to remove the bundled brotli or Muuri and load those from CDN instead, since we have to deploy to a server anyway.

Brotli is from [brotli-wasm](https://github.com/httptoolkit/brotli-wasm), licensed Apache, with built files pulled directly from CDN.

[Muuri](https://github.com/haltu/muuri) (previously included) is licensed MIT.

# Card Sort

Card Sort is a **free** and open-source tool for conducting a virtual card sorting. It was built as a way to **quickly conduct a card sorting online**, without the need to sign up or subscribe to commercial solutions or self-host an open-source project.

It works best when combined with other tooling. For example you could create a form with instructions, questionnaire and a link to the card sorting. You could also ask the participants to copy the results back into the form.

Analysis tools are in development. If you're interested, you can take a look at the [current progress](https://indigane.github.io/cardsort/analysis.html) and discuss [in the issues page](https://github.com/indigane/cardsort/issues/2).

## Advanced use

### Images

Images can be added to the cards by typing `image:` and a link to the image.

```
image:https://domain.tld/image.jpg
```

Text can also be included before or after an image.

```
image:https://domain.tld/cat.jpg A photo of a cat
```

### Programmatic use

Query parameters can be passed to the card sorting page instead of going through the creation form.

All parameters are optional.
